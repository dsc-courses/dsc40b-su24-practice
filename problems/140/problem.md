Suppose $$T$$ is a hash table of size 100 (that is, it has 100 bins). 300 elements are inserted into the hash table using a hash function that satisfies the uniform hashing assumption (that is, any element is equally-likely to hash into any bin). What is the expected number of elements in the first bin?
