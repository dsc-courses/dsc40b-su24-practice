\begin{prob}
    Let $G = (V, E)$ be a directed graph with $|V| > 1$. Suppose that every
    node in $G$ is reachable from every other node. True or False: each node in
    the graph must have an out-degree of at least one and an in-degree of at
    least one.

    \begin{soln}
        True.
    \end{soln}

\end{prob}
