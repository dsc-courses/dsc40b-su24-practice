\begin{prob}
    Suppose you are given a (possibly unsorted) array of $n$ floating point numbers and are tasked with counting the number
    of elements in the array which are within ten of the array's maximum (you are not told the maximum).
    That is, you must count the number of elements $x$ such that $m - x \geq 10$, where $m$ is the array's
    maximum. You may assume that the array does not contain duplicate numbers.

    What is the \textbf{tight} theoretical lower bound for the worst case time complexity of this problem?

    \begin{soln}
        $\Theta(n)$.

        It takes $\Theta(n)$ time to find the maximum. After this, we loop through and keep track of how many
        elements are within ten of the maximum -- this also takes $\Theta(n)$ time.
    \end{soln}

\end{prob}
