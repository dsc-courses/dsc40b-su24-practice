\begin{prob}
    Suppose you are given a (possibly unsorted) array containing $n$ elements.
    Each element is either zero or one. You are tasked with determining if
    the majority (at least half) of the array's elements are one.

    What is the \textbf{tight} theoretical lower bound for the worst case time
    complexity of this problem?

    \begin{soln}
        $\Theta(n)$
    \end{soln}

\end{prob}
