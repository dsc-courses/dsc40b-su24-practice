    Again consider a ``2-chain'' graph, which was defined above to the a graph
    with $n$ nodes that is constructed by taking $n$ nodes labeled 1, 2, $\ldots$,
    $n$, and, for each node $u$, making an edge to nodes $u + 1$ and $u + 2$
    (if they are in the graph).

    Suppose the Bellman-Ford algorithm without early stopping is run on a
    2-chain graph with $n$ nodes, using node 1 as the source. What is the time
    taken as a function of $n$? State your answer using asymptotic notation.

        $\Theta(n^2)$
