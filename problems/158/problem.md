Suppose a depth first search is run on the graph shown below using node $$u_4$$ as the source, and adopt the convention that `graph.neighbors` produces nodes in ascending order of label. Which node will have the smallest finish time?

(x) $$u_1$$

( ) $$u_3$$
( ) $$u_4$$
( ) $$u_5$$
( ) $$u_6$$
( ) $$u_7$$
( ) $$u_8$$
( ) $$u_9$$
