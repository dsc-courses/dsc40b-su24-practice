\begin{prob}

    Suppose we modify \mintinline{python}{binary_search} so that instead of using the floor operation
    to find the middle element of the array, we use the ceiling operation (recall that the
    ceiling of a real number $x$ is the smallest integer that is $\geq x$). The full code is
    shown below for convenience:

    \inputminted{python}{./code.py}

    You may assume that \mintinline{python}{arr} will be a sorted list containing at least
    one number, and that the initial call to \mintinline{python}{new_binary_search} will be
    with \mintinline{python}{start = 0} and \mintinline{python}{stop = len(arr)}.

    \begin{subprobset}

        \begin{subprob}

            True or False:
            there are input arrays on which
            \mintinline{python}{new_binary_search} will recurse infinitely.

            \Tf{}

            \begin{soln}
                True.
            \end{soln}

        \end{subprob}

        \begin{subprob}

            True or False: there are input arrays on which
            \mintinline{python}{new_binary_search} will raise an \mintinline{python}{IndexError}
            because it attempts to access an element of the array which does
            not exist.

            \Tf{}

            \begin{soln}
                True.
            \end{soln}

        \end{subprob}

    \end{subprobset}

\end{prob}
