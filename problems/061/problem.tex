\begin{prob}
    Define the \textbf{largest gap} in a collection of numbers to be the largest difference
    between two distinct elements in the collection (in absolute value).
    For example, the largest gap in $\{4, 9, 1, 6\}$ is 8 (between 1 and 9).

    Suppose a collection of $n$ numbers is stored in a \textbf{balanced} binary search
    tree.
    What is the time complexity required for an efficient algorithm to calculate
    the largest gap of the numbers in the BST? State your answer as a function of $n$ in
    asymptotic notation.

    \begin{soln}
        $\Theta(\log n)$
    \end{soln}
