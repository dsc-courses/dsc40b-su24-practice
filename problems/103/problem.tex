\begin{prob}
    Let $G$ be an undirected graph, and let $u, v,$ and $z$ be three nodes in the graph. Consider
    the problem of finding a shortest path from $u$ to $v$ which passes through node $z$.

    True or False: a shortest path from $u$ to $v$ passing through $z$ may include node $u$ twice.

    \begin{soln}
        True.

        Consider the "chain" graph A - B - C - D - E. The shortest path from C to E
        that passes through B is C - B - C - D - E. It passes through C twice.
