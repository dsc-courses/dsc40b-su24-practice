\begin{prob}
    Suppose a ``2-chain'' graph with $n$ nodes is constructed by taking $n$
    nodes labeled 1, 2, $\ldots$, $n$, and, for each node $u$, making an edge to
    nodes $u + 1$ and $u + 2$ (if they are in the graph).

    For example, such a graph with $n = 7$ looks like:

    Suppose BFS is run on a 2-chain graph with $n$ nodes, using node 1 as the
    source. What is the time taken as a function of $n$? State your answer
    using asymptotic notation.

    \begin{soln}
        $\Theta(n)$
    \end{soln}
