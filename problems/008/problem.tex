\begin{prob}

    Consider the same problem as above, except now you may assume that the array
    is \textbf{sorted}. What is the \textbf{tight} theoretical lower bound for the worst
    case time complexity of any algorithm which solves this problem?

    \begin{soln}
        $\Theta(1)$
    \end{soln}
