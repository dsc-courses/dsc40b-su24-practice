\begin{prob}
    The code below takes in an array of $n$ numbers and checks whether there is a pair
    of numbers in the array which, when added together, equal the maximum element of the
    array.

    What is the \textbf{best case} time complexity of this code as a function of $n$?
    State your answer using asymptotic notation.

    \begin{soln}
        $\Theta(n)$
    \end{soln}
