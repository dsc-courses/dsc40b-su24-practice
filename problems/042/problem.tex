\begin{prob}
    Consider the code below which claims to compute the maximum of the input array.
    Adopt the convention that the maximum of an empty array is $-\infty$.

    \inputminted{python}{./code.py}

    Will this code always return the correct answer (the maximum)? If yes, simply say
    so. If no, describe what might happen (recurse infinitely, return the wrong answer,
    raise an index error, etc.).

    \begin{soln}
        This code will recurse infinitely when called on an array with a single element.
    \end{soln}
\end{prob}
