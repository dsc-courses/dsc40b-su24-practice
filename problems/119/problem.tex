\begin{prob}
    Suppose the Bellman-Ford algorithm is run on a graph $G$ that does not
    contain negative cycles. Let $u$ be an arbitrary node in the graph, and
    assume that $u$ is reachable from the source.

    True or False: $u$'s estimated distance can change multiple times during
    the algorithm's execution.
