\begin{prob}
    An \textit{isolated} node in an undirected graph is a node that has no
    neighbors.

    Suppose a graph $G = (V, E)$ is represented using an adjacency matrix. What
    is the best possible worst-case time complexity of an efficient algorithm
    for computing the number of isolated nodes in the graph? State your answer
    as a function of $|V|$ and $|E|$ using asymptotic notation.

    \begin{soln}
        $\Theta(V^2)$
    \end{soln}

\end{prob}
