\begin{prob}
    Suppose $f(n)$ is both $O(n^2)$ and $\Omega(n)$, and suppose $g(n) = \Theta(n^3)$.
    What are the tightest possible asymptotic bounds that can
    be placed on $f + g$?

    If the upper and lower bounds are the same, you may use $\Theta$. If the
    upper and lower bounds are different, you should state them separately
    using $O$ and $\Omega$.

    \begin{soln}
        $\Theta(n^3)$
    \end{soln}
\end{prob}
