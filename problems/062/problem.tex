\begin{prob}
    Consider the iterative implementation of binary search shown below:
    \inputminted{python}{./code.py}

    Which of the following loop invariants is true, assuming that
    \mintinline{python}{arr} is sorted and non-empty, and \mintinline{python}{target} is \textbf{not} in the array? Select all that apply.

    \begin{choices}[rectangle]
        \correctchoice  After each iteration, \mintinline{python}{stop - start >= 0}.
        \choice  After each iteration, \mintinline{python}{stop - start >= 1}.
        \choice  After each iteration, \mintinline{python}{arr[start] <= target}.
    \end{choices}

    \begin{soln}
        The first option is correct.
    \end{soln}
\end{prob}
