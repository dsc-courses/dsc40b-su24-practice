\begin{prob}
    In a DFS on an undirected graph $G$, the start time of node $u$ is 12, while the
    finish time of node $u$ is 37. How many nodes were marked pending between the moment
    that node $u$ was marked pending and the moment that it was marked visited? Node
    $u$ itself should be \emph{excluded} from your count.

    \begin{soln}
        12
    \end{soln}
