\begin{prob}
    Let $f$ and $g$ be as in the previous question. What are the tightest possible
    asymptotic bounds that can be placed on the product, $f \times g$?

    As before, if the upper and lower bounds are the same, you may use $\Theta$; otherwise
    you should use $O$ and $\Omega$.

    \begin{soln}
        $O(n^5)$ and $\Omega(n^4)$
    \end{soln}

\end{prob}
