Suppose a *breadth* first search (BFS) is run on a graph $$G = (V, E)$$, and that node $$u$$ is distance 5 from the source while node $$v$$ is distance 3 from the source. True or False: it is possible that at some point during the BFS, both $$u$$ and $$v$$ are in the pending queue at the same time.

( ) True
(x) False
