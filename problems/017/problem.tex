\begin{prob}

    Suppose we modify \mintinline{python}{binary_search} so that instead of using the floor operation
    to find the middle element of the array, we use the ceiling operation (recall that the
    ceiling of a real number $x$ is the smallest integer that is $\geq x$). The full code is
    shown below for convenience:

    \inputminted{python}{./code.py}

    Which of the following statements about the correctness of
    \mintinline{python}{new_binary_search} is true? You may assume that \mintinline{python}{arr} will
    be a list containing at least one number, and that the initial call to
    \mintinline{python}{new_binary_search} will be with \mintinline{python}{start = 0} and \mintinline{python}{stop
    = len(arr) - 1}.

    \begin{choices}
        \choice \mintinline{python}{new_binary_search} is guaranteed to work correctly (it will find the index of
        the target, if the target is in the array, and return \mintinline{python}{None} otherwise).
        \correctchoice \mintinline{python}{new_binary_search} may recurse infinitely
        \choice \mintinline{python}{new_binary_search} may raise an \mintinline{python}{IndexError}
        because it may attempt to access an element of the array which does not
        exist
        \choice \mintinline{python}{new_binary_search} is guaranteed to return without
        raising an exception, but it may sometimes return the wrong answer
    \end{choices}

    \begin{soln}
        \mintinline{python}{new_binary_search} may recurse infinitely
    \end{soln}

\end{prob}
