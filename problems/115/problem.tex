\begin{prob}

    Suppose an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ is a tree with 33 edges. Suppose a node $s$ is used as the source
    of a depth-first search.

    Including the root call of \mintinline{python}{dfs} on node $s$, how many calls to \mintinline{python}{dfs} will be made?

    \begin{soln}
        34
    \end{soln}

\end{prob}
