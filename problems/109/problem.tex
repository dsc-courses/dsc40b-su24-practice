    Consider the code below, which is a modification of the code for
    \mintinline{python}{bfs} given in lecture:

    \inputminted{python}{./code.py}

    Notice the two new lines; these lines print all node statuses any time that
    an undiscovered node has been found.

    What is the time complexity of this modified \mintinline{python}{modified_full_bfs}?
    State your answer in asymptotic notation in terms of the number of nodes,
    $|V|$, and the number of edges, $|E|$. You may assume that the graph is
    represented using an adjacency list.

    \begin{soln}
        $\Theta(V^2)$
    \end{soln}

\end{prob}
