\begin{prob}
    Suppose \mintinline{python}{binary_search} has been called on an array \mintinline{python}{arr}
    with a target \mintinline{python}{t} that is not necessarily in the array, and with
    start and stop indices \mintinline{python}{start} and \mintinline{python}{stop}, respectively
    (remember, our convention is that the start index is included, while the
    stop index is excluded from the search). Which of the following must be true?
    \textbf{Mark all which apply}. You may assume that \mintinline{python}{stop - start} $\geq 1$.

    Note: remember that any statement about an empty array is considered to be
    automatically true. Also, you cannot assume that this call to \mintinline{python}{binary_search}
    is the \textit{root} call (it could be a recursive call).

    \begin{choices}
        \choice  \mintinline{python}{arr[start] < t < arr[stop]}
        \choice  \mintinline{python}{arr[start] < t < arr[stop - 1]}
        \correctchoice  \mintinline{python}{arr[:start] < t}. That is, everything up to but
            excluding \mintinline{python}{arr[start]} is less than the target.
        \correctchoice  \mintinline{python}{arr[stop:] > t}. That is, everything after \mintinline{python}{stop},
            including the element at \mintinline{python}{stop}, is greater than the target.
    \end{choices}

    \begin{soln}
        The last two answers are both correct.
    \end{soln}
\end{prob}
