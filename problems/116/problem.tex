\begin{prob}

    Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected tree.

    Suppose breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) are each
    run on the graph using the same source node. True or False: for any node
    $u$ in the graph, the BFS predecessor of $u$ and the DFS predecessor of $u$
    must be the same.

    \begin{soln}
        True.
    \end{soln}
