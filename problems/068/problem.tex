\begin{prob}
    Consider the modification of \mintinline{python}{mergesort} shown below, where one of the
    recursive calls has been replaced by an in-place version of
    \mintinline{python}{selection_sort}. Recall that \mintinline{python}{selection_sort} takes $\Theta(n^2)$
    time.

    \inputminted{python}{./code.py}

    What is the time complexity of \mintinline{python}{kinda_mergesort}?

    \begin{soln}
        $\Theta(n^2)$
    \end{soln}
\end{prob}
