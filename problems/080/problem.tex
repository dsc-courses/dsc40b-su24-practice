\begin{prob}
    Suppose a collection of $n$ numbers is stored in a balanced binary
    search tree. What is the time complexity required of an efficient algorithm
    to calculate the mean of the collection? State your answer as a function of
    $n$ in asymptotic notation.

    \begin{soln}
        $\Theta(n)$
    \end{soln}

\end{prob}
