\begin{prob}
    Consider calling \mintinline{python}{full_bfs} on a \textit{directed} graph, and recall
    that \mintinline{python}{full_bfs} will make calls to \mintinline{python}{bfs} until all nodes have been marked as visited.

    True or False: the number of calls made to \mintinline{python}{bfs} depends on the order in which \mintinline{python}{graph.nodes}
    produces the graph's nodes. That is, if nodes are produced in a different order, the number of calls to \mintinline{python}{bfs}
    may be different.
