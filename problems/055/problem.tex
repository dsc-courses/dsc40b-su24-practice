\begin{prob}
    Suppose the numbers
        \mintinline{python}{41},
        \mintinline{python}{32},
        and
        \mintinline{python}{33}
    are inserted (in that order) into the below binary search tree. Draw where
    the new nodes will appear.

    \begin{soln}
        41 will become the left child of 46.

        32 will become the left child of 35.

        33 will become the right child of 32.
    \end{soln}
