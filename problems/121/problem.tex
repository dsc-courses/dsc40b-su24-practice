\begin{prob}
    Suppose a hash table with $n/2$ bins stores $n$ elements, and suppose that when the
    next element is inserted into the hash table, a ``grow'' will be triggered. That is,
    the insertion will cause the hash table to resize to $n$ bins containing the same
    $n + 1$ elements, plus the newly-added element.

    What will be the time complexity of this single insertion operation that causes
    the table to grow?

    \begin{soln}
        $\Theta(n)$
    \end{soln}
