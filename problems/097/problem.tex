\begin{prob}
    Consider the code below:

    \inputminted{python}{./code.py}

    What is the expected time complexity of this code if \mintinline{python}{A} and
    \mintinline{python}{B} are Python \mintinline{python}{set}s (hash tables) with $n$ elements each?
    State your answer as a function of $n$ using asymptotic notation.
    You may assume that the hash function used is ``good'' in that it hashes
    evenly (that is, it satisfies the simple universal hashing assumption).

    \begin{soln}
        $\Theta(n)$
    \end{soln}

\end{prob}
