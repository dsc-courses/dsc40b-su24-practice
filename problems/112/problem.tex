\begin{prob}
    Let $G$ be a graph, and suppose $s$, $u$, and $v$ are three nodes in the graph.

    Suppose a depth-first search (DFS) is run on $G$ using node $s$ as the
    source and adopting the convention that a node's neighbors are produced in
    ascending order by label. During this DFS, start and finish times are
    computed. Suppose it is found that:
    \[
        \text{start}[u]
        <
        \text{start}[v]
        <
        \text{finish}[v]
        <
        \text{finish}[u]
    \]

    Now suppose another DFS is run using node $s$ as the source, but adopting a different
    convention about the order in which neighbors are produced. Suppose \mintinline{python}{new_start}
    and \mintinline{python}{new_finish} are the start and finish times found by this second DFS. True
    or False: it must be that

    \[
        \text{new_start}[u]
        <
        \text{new_start}[v]
        <
        \text{new_finish}[v]
        <
        \text{new_finish}[u]
    \]

    \begin{soln}
        False.
