\begin{prob}
    Suppose a hash table in constructed so that collisions are resolved through chaining. The hash
    table has a number of bins $k$ that is $\Theta(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements being
    stored in the hash table; that is, the hash table grows as more elements are inserted.

    Suppose the hash function uses only the first $k / 2$ bins of the hash table, but appears to
    hash items into these bins evenly.

    What is the expected time complexity of a membership query on
    this hash table? State your answer in asymptotic notation in terms of the
    number of elements in the hash table, $n$.

    \begin{soln}
        $\Theta(1)$

        Since only $k/2$ bins are being used, the expected number of elements
        within each bin is $n / (k/2) = 2n / k$. But since $k = \Theta(n)$, this
        is just $\Theta(1)$.
    \end{soln}
