\begin{prob}
    Suppose the Bellman-Ford algorithm with early stopping is run on the
    weighted graph shown below using node $s$ as the source (the edge weights are
    intentionally not shown). In the worst case, how many iterations of Bellman-Ford will
    be performed? That is, how many iterations of the outer \mintinline{python}{for}-loop will
    occur?
