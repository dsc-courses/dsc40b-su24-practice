\begin{prob}

    Suppose that a breadth-first search on an undirected graph $G$ is paused
    and the queue is printed. Suppose that every node in the queue is either
    distance 5 from the source, or distance 6. At this moment, node $u$ is
    undiscovered.

    True or False: it is possible that
    node $u$ is distance 4 from the source.

    \begin{soln}
        False.
    \end{soln}

\end{prob}
