    Consider the code below, which shows \mintinline{python}{binary_search} as discussed in 
    lecture, but with one additional line: a print statement.

    \inputminted{python}{./code.py}

    Suppose this version of binary search is called on an array and with a target
    of \mintinline{python}{t = 7}. Which of the following statements is true?

    \begin{choices}
        \choice All of the printed values must be less than or equal to 7.
        \choice All of the printed values must be greater than or equal to 7.
        \correctchoice Some of the printed values may be less than or equal to 7, and some may be greater than or
        equal to 7.
    \end{choices}


    \begin{soln}
        Some of the printed values may be less than or equal to 7, and some may be greater than or
        equal to 7.
    \end{soln}


\end{prob}
