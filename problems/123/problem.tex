\begin{prob}
    Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph, and suppose that $u, v, $ and $w$
    are three nodes in $V$. Suppose that $u$ and $v$ are in the same connected component,
    but $u$ and $w$ are not in the same connected component. True or False: it
    is possible that $v$ and $w$ are in the same connected component.
