\begin{prob}
    Define the \textbf{smallest gap} in a collection of numbers to be the smallest difference
    between two distinct elements in the collection (in absolute value).
    For example, the smallest gap in $\{4, 9, 1, 6\}$ is 2 (between 4 and 6).

    Suppose a collection of $n$ numbers is stored in a \textbf{balanced} binary search
    tree. 
    What is the time complexity required for an efficient algorithm to calculate
    the smallest gap of the numbers in the BST? State your answer as a function of $n$ in
    asymptotic notation.

    \begin{soln}
        $\Theta(n)$
    \end{soln}
