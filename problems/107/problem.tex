    Suppose a breadth-first search (BFS) is performed in order to calculate a
    dictionary of shortest path distances, \mintinline{python}{dist}, from a source node
    $s$ to all nodes reachable from $s$ in an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$.

    Suppose node $u$ is a node in $G$, and $v_1$ and $v_2$ are two neighbors of
    node $u$. Assume that $u$ is reachable from $s$.

    \begin{subprobset}

        \begin{subprob}
            What is the \textit{largest} that $|$\mintinline{python}{dist[v_2] - dist[v_1]}$|$ can be?

            \begin{soln}
                2
            \end{soln}

        \end{subprob}
