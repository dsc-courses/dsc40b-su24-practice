Suppose that every edge in the weighted graph $$G$$ has weight -5. True or False: breadth first search on this graph will compute a *longest* path from the source to every node in the graph (that is, a path with greatest possible total edge weight).

You may assume that every node in the graph is reachable from the source.

(x) True
( ) False
