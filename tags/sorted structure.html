        <div class="problem">
    <div class="problem-body">
<p>Suppose <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> are two numbers, with <span class="math">\(a \leq b\)</span>. Consider the problem of counting the number of elements in an array which are between <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>; that is, the number of elements <span class="math">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(a
    \leq x \leq b\)</span>. You may assume for simplicity that both <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> are in the array, and there are no duplicates.</p>
<div class="subproblem">
    <h3 class="subproblem-id">Part 1)</h3>
<p>What is a <b>tight</b> theoretical lower bound for this problem, assuming that the array is <b>unsorted</b>? State your answer in asymptotic notation as a function of the number of elements in the array, <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>
<p><span class="math">\(\Theta(n)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since the array is in arbitrary order, we have to at least read all of the elements, taking <span class="math">\(\Omega(n)\)</span> time. This is a tight lower bound, because we can count the number of elements between <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> by looping through and checking whether each element is in <span class="math">\([a, b]\)</span> in linear time.</p>

<div class="subproblem">
    <h3 class="subproblem-id">Part 2)</h3>
<p>What is a <b>tight</b> theoretical lower bound for this problem, assuming that the array is <b>sorted</b>? State your answer in asymptotic notation as a function of the number of elements in the array, <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>
<p><span class="math">\(\Theta(\log n)\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can do this in worst-case <span class="math">\(\Theta(\log n)\)</span> time with binary search: find the index of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> in worst-case <span class="math">\(\Theta(\log n)\)</span> time; find the index of <span class="math">\(b\)</span> in worst-case <span class="math">\(\Theta(\log n)\)</span> time; and subtract the two indices (and add one) to get the total number of elements between <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, inclusive.</p>
<p>There cannot be an algorithm that is better than <span class="math">\(\Theta(\log n)\)</span> in the worst case, so this is a tight lower bound. To see why, recognize that we can solve the query problem (determine True/False if a target <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is in a sorted array) with any algorithm that solves this problem by setting <span class="math">\(a = b = t\)</span>. If an algorithm solves this problem in faster than <span class="math">\(\Theta(\log n)\)</span>, it will also solve the query problem in faster than <span class="math">\(\Theta(\log n)\)</span>, but we saw in class that the query problem has a theoretical lower bound of <span class="math">\(\Theta(\log n)\)</span>, so such an algorithm cannot exist.</p>
